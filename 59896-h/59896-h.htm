  MORNING<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Old, old is the sea to-day.<br />
  A sudden stealth of age<br />
  Has torn away<br />
  The texture of its youth and grace,<br />
  And filched the rose of daybreak from its waters.<br />
  Now lines of grey<br />
  And dragging vapors on its brow<br />
  Heavily are drawn;<br />
  And it lies broken as with centuries,<br />
  Though yesterday,<br />
  Blue-eyed and shadowless as a child's face,<br />
  It held the promise of a luminous dawn;<br />
  Though through its merry after-hours<br />
  It bade the sun to pour<br />
  Its flaming mintage on the ocean floor<br />
  That by a conjuror's touch was turned<br />
  To rarer treasure manifold,<br />
  Where jacinth, emerald and sapphire burned&mdash;<br />
  A fringe around a core of gold....<br />
  Old, old is the sea to-day,<br />
  Forsaken, chill and grey,<br />
  And banished is the glory of its waters;<br />
  Though through the silent tenure of the night<br />
  It bade the sterile moon to multiply<br />
  A thousand-fold its undivided light,<br />
  Within the nadir of a richer sky;<br />
  When every star a thousand cressets glowed<br />
  That, caught in wider conflagration, sent<br />
  Vast leagues of silver fire wherever flowed<br />
  The waters of its shoreless firmament.<br />
  But old and grey<br />
  Is the sea to-day,<br />
  With the morning colors blanched upon its waters.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What hidden soul residing<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within these forms, O sea!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should, every hour changing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Time yet changeless be?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What masks hast thou not worn,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What parts not played,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou Prince of all the Revels<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Life's Masquerade?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light-hearted as a jester,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motley fits thy mood,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the gold and the purple,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy statelier habitude.</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn&mdash;<br />
  A trumpeter preluding a day's pageant.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon&mdash;<br />
  A dancer weaving new measures around the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;furrows of ships with white sails.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later&mdash;<br />
  A courier with sealed tidings hastening towards the shore.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sunset&mdash;<br />
  A dyer steeping colors on a bay.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again&mdash;<br />
  A sculptor teasing faces out of the moonlit foam on a reef.<br />
  Or carving bric-a-brac upon a beach,<br />
  Or fashioning, with age-toiled hands, a grotto<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of limestone.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blows&mdash;<br />
  And a master puts a flute to his lips.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It blows again&mdash;<br />
  And his fingers take hold of organ stops ....<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
  THE DESTROYER<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Once more, the wind&mdash;<br />
  And thou dost go on an old familiar way<br />
  In tragic fashion,<br />
  As a corsair, pursuing his prey<br />
  With the lust of passion,<br />
  Falls like a burst of hail<br />
  On an autumn yield,<br />
  Till every reach and gulf and bay<br />
  Is left with the stubble of life and sail,<br />
  With the face of the waters like unto the face of the field.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
  IN RETREAT<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now like a fugitive, who, on the desert sand,<br />
  A moment broods upon the life he spilt.<br />
  And, with averted gaze,<br />
  Circling the dusky ruin of his hand,<br />
  Surveys<br />
  The Arab measure of his guilt<br />
  Before a Presence standing there that calls<br />
  His name; in cloud and shadow and in whirlwind reads<br />
  The inviolate scripture of the fates;<br />
  Then full across the desert speeds,<br />
  Until he falls,<br />
  Caught by the Avenger near the City Gates;&mdash;<br />
  So underneath the heavens' lighted scroll,<br />
  Ablaze with cryptic tokens of the slain,<br />
  Headlong to shore thy spiral waters roll<br />
  Swept by the besom of the winds; by rain<br />
  And thunder driven in flight<br />
  Along the galleries of the night,<br />
  Until upon the surge-line locked in strife<br />
  With reef and breaker thou art shattered, soon<br />
  In fang and sinew to be strewn<br />
  Around the cliffs that guard the ports of life.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O wild, tumultuous sea!<br />
  Thy waters mock our liturgy,<br />
  For thou dost take the threads of faith apart.<br />
  Wherewith the cables of our life are spun,<br />
  Strand upon strand unravelling;&mdash;thou dost hear,<br />
  Recited from a tide-wet shore,<br />
  Our creeds.  Each hope and fear<br />
  Filtered from life's confessions&mdash;one by one,<br />
  Out of the dumb confusions of the heart,<br />
  Are spread before thy sight&mdash;thou Arch-Inquisitor!<br />
  How in a ruthless moment dost thou strip<br />
  The veilings from our eyes, and bid us cast<br />
  Our glances on a labyrinthine past,<br />
  Stirred by a flash that on a wave's white lip<br />
  Gleams for an instant, or by some dark sign<br />
  Within thy fearful hollows where night flings<br />
  Her crape of shadow on a tossing line<br />
  Of jetsam, will our years turn back,<br />
  To gather from a weed-grown track<br />
  A bitter tale of dimmed rememberings.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
  RE-BORN<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As to its end the tempest drags<br />
  Its way, thou art re-born<br />
  To strength of body and beauty of face;<br />
  And thou dost cover with a tranquil grace<br />
  Those whom the winds had buffeted,<br />
  And laid upon the waters&mdash;dead.<br />
  In darkness dost thou cover them,<br />
  As some white-winged mother of the crags,<br />
  That daily gathering food<br />
  From sea-weed and from tide-wash, brings,<br />
  At fall of night, to her rock-nurtured brood<br />
  The drowsy silence of her wings.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
  THE DEAD CALM<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  How like a Pontiff dost thou lie at last,<br />
  Impassive, robed at Death's high-unctioned hour<br />
  With those grey vestments that the storm,<br />
  In the dread legacy of its power,<br />
  Around thy level form<br />
  Majestically hast cast,&mdash;<br />
  In the pale light of the moon's slow tapers burning;<br />
  All-silent in the calm recessional<br />
  Of the tide's turning;<br />
  All-passionless, though on the distant sands<br />
  Where the wreathed lilies of the spray, keen-sifted<br />
  By the late winds, are strewn, thy children call,<br />
  Their patient hands<br />
  In prayer, to thee, uplifted.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  The Toll of the Bells<br />
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  I<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We gave them at the harbor every token&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ritual of the guns, and at the mast<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flag half-high, and as the cortege passed,<br />
  All that remained by our dumb hearts unspoken.<br />
  And what within the band's low requiem,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In footfall or in head uncovered fails<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of final tribute, shall at altar-rails<br />
  Around a chancel soon be offered them.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And now a throbbing organ-prelude dwells<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eternal story of the sea;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following in undertone, the Litany<br />
  Ends like a sobbing wave; and now begins<br />
  A tale of life's fore-shortened days; now swells<br />
  The tidal triumph of Corinthians.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
  II<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But neither trumpet-blast, nor the hoarse din<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of guns, nor the drooped signals from those mute<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banners, could find a language to salute<br />
  The frozen bodies that the ships brought in.<br />
  To-day the vaunt is with the grave.  Sorrow<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has raked up faith and burned it like a pile<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of driftwood, scattering the ashes while<br />
  Cathedral voices anthemed God's To-morrow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Out from the belfries of the town there swung<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great notes that held the winds and the pagan roll<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of open seas within their measured toll.<br />
  Only the bells' slow ocean tones, that rose<br />
  And hushed upon the air, knew how to tongue<br />
  That Iliad of Death upon the floes.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  The Ground-Swell<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Three times we heard it calling with a low,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insistent note; at ebb-tide on the noon;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the hour of dusk, when the red moon<br />
  Was rising and the tide was on the flow;<br />
  Then, at the hour of midnight once again,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we had entered in and shut the door<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drawn the blinds, it crept up from the shore<br />
  And smote upon a bedroom window-pane;<br />
  Then passed away as some dull pang that grew<br />
  Out of the void before Eternity<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had fashioned out an edge for human grief;<br />
  Before the winds of God had learned to strew<br />
  His harvest-sweepings on a winter sea<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feed the primal hungers of a reef.<br />

<h3>
  Magnolia Blossoms<br />
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  I<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The year's processionals mocked her as they streamed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the earth with proud, unsullied grace;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each flower in its appointed time and place,<br />
  And the unfolding of each leaf had seemed<br />
  To brand the hope on which her heart had dreamed&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That spring should drive the winter from her face,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And summer with a broken covenant trace<br />
  How spring's indentured pledges were redeemed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Slowly they came, those blown maturities,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In chaste, irenic order, leaf and bud<br />
  And blossom, and red fruit upon the trees,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale blue and yellow in spring flowers, blood<br />
  Of peony and rose&mdash;she knew them all&mdash;<br />
  From the crocus to the aster in the fall.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
  II<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But when the autumn frost had stripped each tree,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every garden of the earth lay bare<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of leaf and flower and fruit, she turned to where<br />
  The sun's immaculate hand was on the sea.<br />
  He touched the waves and from them magically<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilies and violets grew, and jonquils fair<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As those of spring&mdash;all in November air,<br />
  In fine reversal of earth's irony.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
  III<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then a wind from the land sprang up and whipped<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waters till the flowers grew acid-etched<br />
  Upon her heart; but other blooms, rose-lipped,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the fresh autumnal foam were fetched<br />
  By the sun's hand&mdash;strange harvest that achieves<br />
  Its seasonal fruit before the time of leaves.<br />

<h3>
  The Ice-Floes
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Dawn from the Foretop!  Dawn from the Barrel!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scurry of feet with a roar overhead;<br />
  The master-watch wildly pointing to Northward,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the herd in front of <i>The Eagle</i> was spread!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Steel-planked and sheathed like a battleship's nose,<br />
  She battered her path through the drifting floes;<br />
  Past slob and growler we drove, and rammed her<br />
  Into the heart of the patch and jammed her.<br />
  There were hundreds of thousands of seals, I'd swear,<br />
  In the stretch of that field&mdash;"white harps" to spare<br />
  For a dozen such fleets as had left that spring<br />
  To share in the general harvesting.<br />
  The first of the line, we had struck the main herd;<br />
  The day was ours, and our pulses stirred<br />
  In that brisk, live hour before the sun,<br />
  At the thought of the load and the sweepstake won.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We stood on the deck as the morning outrolled<br />
  On the fields its tissue of orange and gold,<br />
  And lit up the ice to the north in the sharp,<br />
  Clear air; each mother-seal and its "harp"<br />
  Lay side by side; and as far as the range<br />
  Of the patch ran out we saw that strange,<br />
  And unimaginable thing<br />
  That sealers talk of every spring&mdash;<br />
  The "bobbing-holes" within the floes<br />
  That neither wind nor frost could close;<br />
  Through every hole a seal could dive,<br />
  And search, to keep her brood alive,<br />
  A hundred miles it well might be,<br />
  For food beneath that frozen sea.<br />
  Round sunken reef and cape she would rove,<br />
  And though the wind and current drove<br />
  The ice-fields many leagues that day,<br />
  We knew she would turn and find her way<br />
  Back to the hole, without the help<br />
  Of compass or log, to suckle her whelp&mdash;<br />
  Back to that hole in the distant floes,<br />
  And smash her way up with her teeth and nose.<br />
  But we flung those thoughts aside when the shout<br />
  Of command from the master-watch rang out.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Assigned to our places in watches of four&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the rails in a wild carouse,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two from the port and starboard bows,<br />
  Two from the broadsides&mdash;off we tore,<br />
  In the breathless rush for the day's attack,<br />
  With the speed of hounds on a caribou's track.<br />
  With the rise of the sun we started to kill,<br />
  A seal for each blow from the iron bill<br />
  Of our gaffs.  From the nose to the tail we ripped them,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid their quivering carcases flat<br />
  On the ice; then with our knives we stripped them<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of the pelt and its lining of fat.<br />
  With three fathoms of rope we laced them fast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their skins to the ice to be easy to drag,<br />
  With our shoulders galled we drew them, and cast<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them in thousands around the watch's flag.<br />
  Then, with our bodies begrimed with the reek<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of grease and sweat from the toil of the day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made for <i>The Eagle</i>, two miles away,<br />
  At the signal that flew from her mizzen peak.<br />
  And through the night, as inch by inch<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached the pans with the harps piled high,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hoisted them up as the hours filed by<br />
  To the sleepy growl of the donkey-winch.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Over the bulwarks again we were gone,<br />
  With the first faint streaks of a misty dawn;<br />
  Fast as our arms could swing we slew them,<br />
  Ripped them, "sculped" them, roped and drew them<br />
  To the pans where the seals in pyramids rose<br />
  Around the flags on the central floes,<br />
  Till we reckoned we had nine thousand dead<br />
  By the time the afternoon had fled;<br />
  And that an added thousand or more<br />
  Would beat the count of the day before.<br />
  So back again to the patch we went<br />
  To haul, before the day was spent,<br />
  Another load of four "harps" a man,<br />
  To make the last the record pan.<br />
  And not one of us saw, as we gaffed, and skinned,<br />
  And took them in tow, that the north-east wind<br />
  Had veered off-shore; that the air was colder;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the signs of recall were there to the south,<br />
  The flag of <i>The Eagle</i>, and the long, thin smoulder<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drifted away from her funnel's mouth.<br />
  Not one of us thought of the speed of the storm<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hounded our tracks in the day's last chase<br />
  (For the slaughter was swift, and the blood was warm),<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till we felt the first sting of the snow in our face.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We looked south-east, where, an hour ago,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a smudge on the sky-line, someone had seen<br />
  <i>The Eagle</i>, and thought he had heard her blow<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A note like a warning from her sirene.<br />
  We gathered in knots, each man within call<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his mate, and slipping our ropes, we sped,<br />
  Plunging our way through a thickening wall<br />
  Of snow that the gale was driving ahead.<br />
  We ran with the wind on our shoulder; we knew<br />
  That the night had left us this only clue<br />
  Of the track before us, though with each wail<br />
  That grew to the pang of a shriek from the gale.<br />
  Some of us swore that <i>The Eagle</i> screamed<br />
  Right off to the east; to others it seemed<br />
  On the southern quarter and near, while the rest<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried out with every report that rose<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the strain and the rend of the wind on the floes<br />
  That <i>The Eagle</i> was firing her guns to the west.<br />
  And some of them turned to the west, though to go<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was madness&mdash;we knew it and roared, but the notes<br />
  Of our warning were lost as a fierce gust of snow<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eddied, and strangled the words in our throats.<br />
  Then we felt in our hearts that the night had swallowed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All signals, the whistle, the flare, and the smoke<br />
  To the south; and like sheep in a storm we followed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each other; like sheep we huddled and broke.<br />
  Here one would fall as hunger took hold<br />
  Of his step; here one would sleep as the cold<br />
  Crept into his blood, and another would kneel<br />
  Athwart the body of some dead seal,<br />
  And with knife and nails would tear it apart.<br />
  To flesh his teeth in its frozen heart.<br />
  And another dreamed that the storm was past,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And raved of his bunk and brandy and food,<br />
  And <i>The Eagle</i> near, though in that blast<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother was fully as blind as her brood.<br />
  Then we saw, what we feared from the first&mdash;dark places<br />
  Here and there to the left of us, wide, yawning spaces<br />
  Of water; the fissures and cracks had increased<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the outer pans were afloat, and we knew,<br />
  As they drifted along in the night to the east,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the cries we heard, that some of our crew<br />
  Were borne to the sea on those pans and were lost.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we turned with the wind in our faces again,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took the snow with its lancing pain,<br />
  Till our eye-balls cracked with the salt and the frost;<br />
  Till only iron and fire that night<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survived on the ice as we stumbled on;<br />
  As we fell and rose and plunged&mdash;till the light<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the south and east disclosed the dawn,<br />
  And the sea heaving with floes&mdash;and then,<br />
  <i>The Eagle</i> in wild pursuit of her men.<br />
</p>

  A week before, under his very eyes,<br />

  The pine was planted seventy years ago<br />
  To celebrate his birth,<br />
  It had a right, he said, to live and grow,<br />
  And then into the earth,<br />
  By a mild and understanding law,<br />
  To pass with nature's quiet burial.<br />
  But they had come, those men, with axe and saw,<br />

  It swayed a moment, then with heavy sound,<br />
  Dropped with a crash of branches to the ground.<br />

<i>"The dog that saved the lives of more than
ninety persons in that recent week, by swimming
with a line from the sinking vessel to the

the risk of his mission."&mdash;Extract from a
Newfoundland paper.</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  I see no use in not confessing&mdash;<br />
  To trace your breed would keep me guessing;<br />
  It would indeed an expert puzzle<br />
  To match such legs with a jet-black muzzle.<br />
  To make a mongrel, as you know,<br />
  it takes some fifty types or so,<br />
  And nothing in your height or length,<br />
  In stand or color, speed or strength,<br />
  Could make me see how any strain<br />
  Could come from mastiff, bull, or Dane.<br />
  But, were I given to speculating<br />
  On pedigrees in canine rating,<br />
  I'd wager this&mdash;not from your size,<br />
  Not merely from your human eyes,<br />
  But from the way you held that cable<br />
  Within those gleaming jaws of sable,<br />
  Leaped from the taffrail of the wreck<br />
  With ninety souls upon its deck,<br />
  And with your cunning dog-stroke tore<br />
  Your path unerring to the shore&mdash;<br />
  Yes, stake my life, the way you swam,<br />
  That somewhere in your line a dam,<br />
  Shaped to this hour by God's own hand,<br />
  Had mated with a Newfoundland.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They tell me, Carlo, that your kind<br />
  Has neither conscience, soul, nor mind;<br />
  That reason is a thing unknown<br />
  To such as dogs; to man alone<br />
  The spark divine&mdash;he may aspire<br />
  To climb to heaven or even higher;<br />
  But God has tied around the dog<br />
  The symbol of his fate, the clog.<br />
  Thus, I have heard some preachers say&mdash;<br />
  Wise men and good, in a sort o' way&mdash;<br />
  Proclaiming from the sacred box<br />
  (Quoting from Butler and John Knox)<br />
  How freedom and the moral law<br />
  God gave to man, because He saw<br />
  A way to draw a line at root<br />
  Between the human and the brute.<br />
  And you were classed with things like bats,<br />
  Parrots and sand-flies and dock-rats,<br />
  Serpents and toads that dwell in mud,<br />
  And other creatures with cold blood<br />
  That sightless crawl in slime, and sink.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Gadsooks!  It makes me sick to think<br />
  That man must so exalt his race<br />
  By giving dogs a servile place;<br />
  Prate of his transcendentalism,<br />
  While you save men by mechanism.<br />
  And when I told them how you fought<br />
  The demons of the storm, and brought<br />
  That life-line from the wreck to shore,<br />
  And saved those ninety souls or more,<br />
  They argued with such confidence&mdash;<br />
  'Twas instinct, nature, or blind sense.<br />
  A <i>man</i> could know when he would do it;<br />
  You did it and never knew it.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And so, old chap, by what they say,<br />
  You live and die and have your day,<br />
  Like any cat or mouse or weevil<br />
  That has no sense of good and evil<br />
  (Though sheep and goats, when they have died,<br />
  The Good Book says are classified);<br />
  But you, being neuter, go to&mdash;well,<br />
  Neither to heaven nor to hell.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I'll not believe it, Carlo: I<br />
  Will fetch you with me when I die,<br />
  And, standing up at Peter's wicket,<br />
  Will urge sound reasons for your ticket;<br />
  I'll show him your life-saving label<br />
  And tell him all about that cable,<br />
  The storm along the shore, the wreck,<br />
  The ninety souls upon the deck;<br />
  How one by one they came along,<br />
  The young and old, the weak and strong&mdash;<br />
  Pale women sick and tempest-tossed,<br />
  With children given up for lost;<br />
  I'd tell him more, if he would ask it&mdash;<br />
  How they tied a baby in a basket.<br />
  While a young sailor, picked and able,<br />
  Moved out to steady it on the cable;<br />
  And if he needed more recital<br />
  To admit a mongrel without title,<br />
  I'd get down low upon my knees.<br />
  And swear before the Holy Keys,<br />
  That, judging by the way you swam,<br />
  Somewhere within your line, a dam<br />
  Formed for the job by God's own hand,<br />
  Had littered for a Newfoundland.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I feel quite sure that if I made him<br />
  Give ear to that, I could persuade him<br />
  To open up the Golden Gate<br />
  And let you in; but should he state<br />
  That from your legs and height and speed<br />
  He still had doubts about your breed,<br />
  And called my story of the cable<br />
  "A cunningly deviséd fable,"<br />
  Like other rumors that you've seen<br />
  In Second Peter, one, sixteen,<br />
  I'd tell him (saving his high station)<br />
  The devil take his legislation,<br />
  And, where life, love, and death atone,<br />
  I'd move your case up to the Throne.<br />

  He was.  As bad as you for gall, he'd chin<br />
  The Lord out of his job, on points like sin,<br />
  Damnation and the rest of it.  He told<br />
  Us how the world&mdash;I can't just mind how old,<br />
  He said it was; but just to illustrate<br />
  His point, he took a pencil and a slate,<br />
  Marked five in the left-hand corner near the top,<br />
  And added zeros till he had to stop<br />
  For want of room, and added more by tongue,<br />
  Then ended, claimin' that the world was young.<br />
  Just like a mushroom, so to speak; and when<br />
  He thought he'd finished his explainin', then<br />
  Our pastor put a poser to him straight.<br />
  Just how, he asked him, did he calculate<br />
  It out?&mdash;the parson, I'll allow, was rough<br />
  On questions&mdash;Was the slate not big enough?<br />
  Did he run out of zeros?  Was he sure<br />
  He had the tally right?  A zero more,<br />
  What mattered it, and how did he arrive<br />
  By any kind of reckonin' at that five?<br />
  It looked so lonesome by itself.  Would not<br />
  Another zero do instead?  And what<br />
  Do you allow his answer was?  I've heard<br />
  Some blasphemy against the Livin' Word<br />
  Within my time&mdash;the Livin' Word that says<br />
  The world's bin waggin' now, omittin' days,<br />
  Six thousand years; but Word and Church and Lord,<br />
  The evidence of the Fathers and the Sword<br />
  Of the Spirit, everything&mdash;he cast them out<br />
  With one deliberate, sacrilegious clout.<br />
  He told us&mdash;and it sounded like a boast&mdash;<br />
  He told us&mdash;are you listenin'?&mdash;that the most<br />
  Of all his facts he got from skulls; from graves<br />
  Of savages that one time lived in caves;<br />
  From skeletons of serpents, elephants;<br />
  I think he mentioned bugs and bees and ants<br />
  And frogs' backbones and such, but most of it<br />
  He got from skulls so old that not a bit<br />
  Of chop was left upon the jowls.  He said&mdash;<br />
  Grantin' the man who owned the skull was dead<br />
  So long, the crown had rotted&mdash;yet he'd tell<br />
  The story from the jaw-bone just as well.<br />

  THE PASSING OF JERRY MOORE<br />
</p>

<p class="t3">
  (<i>Juniper Hall answers the critics</i>).<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Did Jerry get through the gates of gold,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To join the white-robed Saints, that basked<br />
  In the glory of the Father's fold?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the question each man asked,<br />
  As Jerry lay with his cold feet<br />
  And his cold hands under the sheet.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The last man, known as Juniper Hall,<br />
  The life-time pal of Jerry Moore,<br />
  Spoke&mdash;as soon as he had the floor&mdash;<br />
  And said he disagreed with them all.<br />
  He thought the judgment of Doran,<br />
  That sanctified and solemn man,<br />
  Put altogether too great store<br />
  Upon the words of Jerry's speech,<br />
  As Jerry sat in the rain and swore<br />
  At the fish that rotted on the beach.<br />
  Why shouldn't a man, who day by day<br />
  Had seen the clouds wipe out the sun<br />
  And botch the work his hands had done,<br />
  Pour out his soul in a natural way,<br />
  On the chance of ridding his chest of it,<br />
  And tell the Lord what he thought of it all&mdash;<br />
  The rain, the fog and a hungry fall,<br />
  The rotten fish and the rest of it?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then Juniper asked why Solomon Rowe<br />
  (Who handed out to sinners gratis<br />
  Timely advice such as might flow<br />
  From him, a saint of ten years' status)<br />
  Should so denounce what occupied<br />
  Old Jerry's mind the night he died.<br />
  He had spent the day in mending a net<br />
  And splicing a rope; without a thought<br />
  About the way a sinner ought<br />
  To make eternal peace, he ate<br />
  His three good hearty meals and went<br />
  To bed.  He took no Sacrament;<br />
  He had no dying pains; he gave<br />
  No groans; nor called the Lord to save<br />
  His soul; but in his dreams he talked,<br />
  With a sort of chuckle in his speech,<br />
  Of a shoal of caplin on the beach,<br />
  And of the punt that he had caulked,<br />
  And other things that he had done.<br />
  The case was proved, for Jake, his son,<br />
  Who lay beside him on the bed,<br />
  Had vouched for all that Solomon said.<br />
  But Jerry's life from the day of his birth<br />
  Was only meant for the jobs of earth,<br />
  Like caulking punts and mending nets,<br />
  And catching fish to pay his debts.<br />
  He would shout like a man with gospel soul<br />
  At the saving news of a herring shoal,<br />
  That swarmed down the bay in the spring,<br />
  And no one louder than Jerry could sing<br />
  As he'd barrel 'em up or smoke 'em,<br />
  His rough, red hands, a-reeking with brine,<br />
  And his clothes with a mixture of turpentine,<br />
  Of tar and cod-liver oil and oakum;<br />
  What wonder then that in his sleep,<br />
  As he dreamed about that caplin shoal,<br />
  The thought should so have tickled his soul<br />
  And made him laugh, instead of weep,<br />
  Like the saints that get so short of breath<br />
  In the last hour before their death?<br />
  Besides, it's claimed he had not met,<br />
  For want of savings, a just debt<br />
  He owed to Rowe before he died.<br />
  But, then, as he had often said,<br />
  The reason why he had not paid<br />
  It off&mdash;the Lord had never dried<br />
  His load of cod; but Solomon Rowe<br />
  Had owed a hundred dollars or so<br />
  For years, though the sun had always shone<br />
  Upon the fish of Solomon.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then Juniper thought that Watchnight Percy&mdash;<br />
  The one who spoke of the Lord's great mercy&mdash;<br />
  Though his heart was right, yet, on the whole,<br />
  Was over-anxious for Jerry's soul.<br />
  Was Jerry's chance, like that of the thief,<br />
  Merely the miracle of belief,<br />
  That in the final midnight hour<br />
  Springs from the Lord Almighty's power<br />
  And heavenly grace?  Juniper could<br />
  Not argue this point for want of light<br />
  So left the question as it stood,<br />
  To deal with the claim of Christopher Wright.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Much that was spoken by Christopher<br />
  Had a measure of truth, said Juniper.<br />
  It was true that Jerry, with his mind<br />
  So bent on worldly things, might find<br />
  Beyond those gates of pearl and gold,<br />
  Within those heavenly pavilions,<br />
  Where white-robed angels by the millions<br />
  Bask in the glory of the fold,<br />
  No angel who would undertake<br />
  To wean his thoughts from earthly things,<br />
  And fit him up with a pair of wings;<br />
  Or&mdash;still more hopeless job&mdash;to make<br />
  Him change his manners and his speech,<br />
  So that those lordly potentates<br />
  Might not be shocked, as Jerry's mates<br />
  Were often shocked upon the beach.<br />
  All this, he said, and more beside<br />
  May yet be true of the man that died&mdash;<br />
  (Jerry, who swore when the mood was on.<br />
  And worried the soul of Solomon;<br />
  Jerry, the most consistent liar<br />
  That ever told a fish-yarn when,<br />
  On a wintry night, a crew of men<br />
  Were gathered around a tamarack fire!)<br />
  "I do not care," said Juniper,<br />
  Looking direct at Christopher,<br />
  "What Gabriel may think of Jerry,<br />
  Or (turning around to stare at Joe)<br />
  What the sins were that Doran might know:<br />
  Or whether he laughed in his sleep and was merry<br />
  In the hour of death, as Jake, his son,<br />
  Who lay beside him in the bed<br />
  Reported the news to Solomon<br />
  Of what the dying man had said."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thus Juniper spoke, his eyes a-glow,<br />
  His bony fingers pointing at Rowe.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then we felt a deep hush fall<br />
  Upon the room, as Juniper Hall<br />
  Spoke to the dead man under the sheet,<br />
  Just as a common man might greet<br />
  A living friend.  "Well, Jerry, old mate,<br />
  They may talk as they like&mdash;now that you're cold&mdash;<br />
  Of those who enter the Father's fold,<br />
  Through mercy and grace.  They may talk of the fate<br />
  Of your soul.  They may shake their heads and groan<br />
  For fear God's mercy was not shown<br />
  To you before you died.  I know<br />
  Nothing of what the angels do,<br />
  Or where the souls of dead men go;<br />
  But I'll take my chance in saying that you,<br />
  Who always did your day's work well,<br />
  Had far too good a soul for hell.<br />
  I do not know the kind of luck<br />
  That came to Christopher and Joe<br />
  And saved from the fire the soul of Rowe,<br />
  Nor how the balances are struck<br />
  At death; but I'd like to state<br />
  If things like contra accounts are stored<br />
  On the shelves of the upper Courts of the Lord.<br />
  Who judges the hearts of men, that your slate,<br />
  Jerry, should tell by a clean score<br />
  How you were head of a life-boat crew,<br />
  With no one as good at the stern oar,<br />
  And always on hand when a storm blew;<br />
  And tell how you pulled young Davie Cole,<br />
  (Who sits on that bench) out of a hole<br />
  In the slob ice one bitter night<br />
  In March when Davey was frozen through,<br />
  And lugged him ashore with his face as white<br />
  As the lip of a ghost, and brought him to,<br />
  With no one around to lend you a hand.<br />
  Yes, Jerry, old mate, if you never reach<br />
  For want of faith the angels' land,<br />
  Without a sea, without a beach,<br />
  Maybe the Lord in His good grace,<br />
  May find close to the boundary<br />
  Of heaven and the outer place,<br />
  A strip of shoreline by a sea,<br />
  Where the winds blow and where you,<br />
  As skipper of a life-boat crew,<br />
  May throw a line across the deck<br />
  Of many a crowded, foundering wreck.<br />
  And on fine days when not aboard<br />
  Your skiff, but lying up, the Lord<br />
  May find odd jobs, perhaps a sail<br />
  To mend, that in a Galilean gale<br />
  Was torn, or one or two old punts<br />
  That He and Simon Peter once<br />
  Used on the lake; or say, 'Here's bark<br />
  And oakum, oil and pitch, all that<br />
  You need; go&mdash;caulk that leaky ark<br />
  That went aground on Ararat.'<br />
  And when you call your gang together,<br />
  Some night in raw December weather<br />
  (The gang made up of your lifeboat crew,<br />
  And other spotted saints of God,<br />
  Exiled to that shore with you<br />
  Because, while on the earth, they trod<br />
  On both the broad and narrow ways)<br />
  To tell your yarns before a blaze<br />
  Of balsam piled on tamarack&mdash;<br />
  That night, I swear, I will come back<br />
  (As stoker from the outer land<br />
  On special leave from Lucifer)<br />
  To start your fire with my brand;<br />
  I swear it now," said Juniper.<br />

  THE HISTORY OF JOHN JONES<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The sun never shone,<br />
  The rain could not fall<br />
  On a steadier man than John.<br />
  A holy man was John,<br />
  And honest withal.<br />
  His mates had never heard<br />
  Drop from his guarded lip<br />
  An idle word,<br />
  But twice&mdash;first, while on board his ship,<br />
  When he had lost his pipe, he swore,<br />
  Just a mild damn, and nothing more;<br />
  And once he cursed<br />
  The government; but then he reckoned<br />
  The Lord forgave him for the first,<br />
  And justified the second.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And he was temperate in all his ways,<br />
  Was John;<br />
  He never drank, but when Thanksgiving days<br />
  Came on;<br />
  Never in summer on a fishing trip<br />
  Would he allow the smell on board his ship;<br />
  Only in winter or in autumn,<br />
  When a cramp or something caught him,<br />
  Would he take it, for he prized it,<br />
  Not for its depraved abuses,<br />
  But for its discreeter uses,<br />
  As his Church had authorized it.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The sun had never shone<br />
  On a kinder man than John,<br />
  Nor upon<br />
  A better Christian than was John.<br />
  He was good to his dog, he was good to his cat,<br />
  And his love went out to his horse;<br />
  He loved the Lord and his Church, of course,<br />
  For righteous was he in thought and act;<br />
  And his neighbors knew, in addition to that,<br />
  He loved his wife, as a matter of fact.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now, one fine day it occurred to John,<br />
  That his last great cramp was on;<br />
  For nothing that the doctor wrote<br />
  Could stop that rattle in his throat.<br />
  He had broken his back upon the oar,<br />
  He had dried his last boat-load of cod,<br />
  And nothing was left for John any more,<br />
  But to drift in his boat to the port of God.<br />

  Answer my riddle, will you?  Nay,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not toss your head that way,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a ruffle of passion.<br />
  I merely asked you who was fleeced<br />
  To pay the jeweller and modiste<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this last word in fashion.<br />
  I have a right, if you only knew,<br />
  To put this delicate point to you&mdash;<br />
  Those sapphires dancing on your crest,<br />
  That cluster of rubies on your breast,<br />
  That necklace there, those pearls!  The price?<br />

<p class="poem">
  And the only kind of reply that came<br />
  Out of that vision of tropical flame<br />

  A tango of color from scarlet to green<br />
  Evolved as I watched the beauty preen<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her plumes in that maddening fashion.<br />
  So I left the Bird of the Garden to call,<br />
  This time, upon the Bird of the Hall;<br />
  For my temples beat with the throb of fire,<br />
  And I could not find in that land of Desire<br />
  A cooling wind, or water, or ice<br />
  To quench a fever in Paradise.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And the only answer I got in the Hall<br />
  Was a glance of repulse from the belle of the Ball,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little ruffle of passion;<br />
  Though I had a right to ask, I am sure,<br />
  Who sent that tiara for her coiffure,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that latest corsage of fashion.<br />
  Not those the jewels I gave her to wear,<br />
  Not those the drops that hung from her ear;<br />
  And my fever burned like a thirst in Sahara,<br />
  When that osprey swung above the tiara,<br />
  And I knew no wind, nor water, nor ice<br />
  Might cool this hell in Paradise.<br />

  Ode to December, 1917<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Was ever night so wild as this&mdash;this bleak December night!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veiled in the sombre shroud that sepulchred the day;<br />
  Why thus bereft of heaven's beams, of moon and starry light,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are all its ancient charms in sorrow laid away?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The year dies out with drifted leaves, with winds<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and floods of rain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companions of the tempest with its brood of fears;<br />
  And voices far above us echo back the world's great pain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tongueless language inarticulate through tears.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Why passed with such inevitable speed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eager splendor of the awakening spring?<br />
  So little did it seem to know or heed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our outward cries, our hidden murmuring;<br />
  It shone upon us shyly for some reason,<br />
  Then flew into the summer's briefer season,<br />
  And found, amidst its roses fully blown,<br />
  A transient radiance fleeter than its own.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  How sweet the flowers grew in the woods last May!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trillium, splashed by sunlight, jauntily<br />
  Awoke to match the whiteness of its ray<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With white of blood-root and anemone.<br />
  Within the stray leaves on the humid ground,<br />
  Beside the fallen trunks of trees, were found<br />
  Numerous hepaticas whose lilac hue<br />
  Seemed woven of heaven's purple and its blue,<br />
  And, near at hand, a running streamlet told<br />
  Of treasure hidden in the marigold.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A little while they stayed; how short the space!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We watched them as the hours went by,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked again, and saw them die&mdash;<br />
  Thus did they pass away; but in their place,<br />
  In meadow and in vale sprang up<br />
  The daisy and the buttercup;<br />
  Then on the creeping slopes of sunny hills,<br />
  By winding dales and tortuous rills,<br />
  Blue vervain rose to greet the sun,<br />
  Ere half the summer's race was run;<br />
  And in the fields and on the plains.<br />
  By forest paths, by country lanes,<br />
  By wayside and in garden plot,<br />
  The bluebell and forget-me-not;<br />
  And fair the bottle-gentian grew<br />
  Beside the wintergreen and rue.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And everywhere around us from the throats<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of joyous birds pealed forth ecstatic praise&mdash;<br />
  Glad hymns in which were heard no notes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dim unrest and troubled lays.<br />
  The heart had never taught them sorrows,<br />
  Regretful yesterdays nor morrows;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each morning brought them its full boon of light,<br />
  And in return they gave their gift of song&mdash;<br />
  Free utterance that had no tale of wrong<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the horizon of their life to right;<br />
  And when the evening drew to twilight close,<br />
  Fell the light mantle of their calm repose.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Fled are they all;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers and the birds,<br />
  In vain we call,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With cries too dumb for words.<br />
  The fragrance and the music gone,<br />
  The fire of sunset, flush of dawn,<br />
  The waterlily in the lake,<br />
  The robin's love-song in the brake;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are fled and gone,<br />
  And with us now the night,<br />
  The wild December night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Far, far away upon the seas<br />
  The billows tell their agonies;<br />
  The ocean in its frenzied roar<br />
  Lashes the ramparts of the shore;<br />
  The tempest with its shattering thunder<br />
  Drives the iron bulwarks under;<br />
  The furies, in their path advancing,<br />
  Are seen around the breakers dancing;<br />
  The sea-mews, blinded by the light<br />
  Of mast-head signals, flaring bright,<br />
  Are rent by blow of spar and sail<br />
  Within the clutches of the gale,<br />
  And sailors, drenched by salt and foam,<br />
  Yearn for the fireside of their home.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And thus upon the land<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth's ravage is laid bare;<br />
  Slapped by the storm's fierce hand,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wildcat and the bear<br />
  Lie huddled in the sand<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That marks their common lair;<br />
  The trees in angry lurch<br />
  That grew beside each other&mdash;<br />
  The hemlock and the birch&mdash;<br />
  Now strive with one another,<br />
  In strangely human mood,<br />
  Born of unnatural feud.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Around the hoary mountain sides<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm hurls its impetuous shock,<br />
  Is answered by the torrent's tides,<br />

  Far, far away, across the distant deep,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven's lightnings flash from out a darker scroll;<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dawnless vigil, as slow thunders roll<br />
  Over a world upon whose face the storm<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaks, and within the terrors of eclipse,<br />
  Fall the swift strokes of Death, clothed in the form<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some dread angel of Apocalypse.<br />
  There rides a tempest heedless of the check<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of law, and with no mandate but its will,<br />
  Whose function lies alone in power to wreck,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never hears the fiat, "Peace, be still!"<br />
  There, through deep, winding valleys that had known<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet haunts of peasants; through the green,<br />
  Sweet-tufted verdure that the spring had sown;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through glens where only roe and fawn were seen<br />
  In peace; through plains where once the sunset's brush<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placed its soft crimson on the silent streams;<br />
  There, through that land that often loved the hush<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of evening and the tenderness of dreams,<br />
  Rolls now the bugle with its alien blast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cry of battle on the midnight air,<br />
  The fiery summons to earth's legions massed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mid bayonets gleaming in the rocket's glare;<br />
  And streams that to the North Sea once had brought<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn's white silver and the sunset's gold,<br />
  Now pour such tides as Nature never wrought.<br />
  The ruddier treasures of a wealth untold.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wrote their names; then gazed awhile, and said:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are the fallen; these, our honored dead,<br />
  The silent ones in Death's vast muster roll.<br />
  This one was strong and ruddy; that one frail,<br />

<p class="poem">

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sad, slow count.  We spoke of things like grass,<br />

  Then, suddenly, through the mist that wrapped our sight,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow, but with mightier accent ever growing<br />
  Around a blazing shaft of central light:<br />
  "Fallen!  There is no downward plunge.  The estate<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is high.  Go!&mdash;roll thy plumb-line up, and ask<br />

<p class="poem">
  The breeze, that with the morn had freshened up,<br />
  Now with the mid-day died.  Far to the east,<br />
  The horizon, clear at dawn, slowly withdrew,<br />
  Its lines dissolving moodily in mist.<br />
  The after hours grew still in sullen peace,<br />
  Save where the ground-swell, uttering a weird note,<br />
  Broke the dead silence.  Soon (a globe of fire<br />
  Behind a bank of smoke that thickened fast<br />
  Against a dull circumference of grey)<br />
  The moon arose, and tongueless vapors stole<br />
  Heavily athwart the sea.  Within her home<br />
  The widow sat alone, peering afar<br />
  Through the raised window at the distant point<br />
  Round which the vessel in the morning sailed.<br />
  She sat, her long, thin fingers intertwined<br />
  And resting in her lap, and now and then<br />
  With drooping head she prayed, or seemed to pray,<br />
  Though neither words nor sound escaped her lips.<br />
  There she remained until the smaller hours<br />
  Had passed; then took her lamp and went to bed&mdash;<br />
  And yet more from the habit of the night<br />
  Than from the weary willingness of sleep.<br />
  Later than usual did the morning break;<br />
  The drops were splashing on the window-pane;<br />
  A heavy fog came drifting down the shore,<br />
  Shrouding both sea and land.  The dread North-East<br />
  Was hoisting forth the signals of her power<br />
  In scurrying fog, and intermittent gusts<br />
  Of rain.  The shoremen, hurrying to the beach,<br />
  Pulled high and dry their boats, and ran their skiffs<br />
  To safer moorings, well inside the bar.<br />
  Another night, and still the blast increased<br />
  Its power, tearing, lifting cottage roofs,<br />
  But nowhere did it make completer ruin<br />
  Than in the heart of Rachel.  By the light<br />
  Of a small lamp she watched the weather glass,<br />
  And saw how, as she tapped it every hour,<br />
  The dark line sank.  It was now, she thought, the ship<br />
  Had reached the weltering tide-rips off Cape Race.<br />
  Would the frail timbers stand the shock of waves?<br />
  And how avoid the reefs when neither moon<br />
  Nor stars gave to the compass friendly aid?<br />
  There seemed no limit to the rising scale<br />
  Through which the tempest climbed.  At times it paused<br />
  To speak with tragic whisperings that clutched<br />
  The widow's pulse, and then with fearful shriek<br />
  It filed her nerve, while from the distant seas<br />
  There came long, whistling interludes of death.<br />
  Another morning came.  The fog had blown<br />
  Away, and through the rift of clouds that massed<br />
  The eastern vault, the fitful sunlight gleamed<br />
  Upon white billows that a thousand leagues<br />
  Had come, and now with jealous leap sought heights<br />
  Unscalable, save to the petrel's wings.<br />
  A week passed by with heavy-shodden feet;<br />
  The hours seemed weighted with unnatural calm,<br />
  So different from the lightsome, freshening stir<br />
  That follows in the usual wake of gales.<br />
  Summer had taken leave, and yet the air<br />
  Seemed bashful of the fall, for every day<br />
  Mirrored the one before, as if the storm<br />
  Had over-wrought its ends, and paralyzed<br />
  The will of nature for the season's change.<br />
  The village-folk again commenced their work,<br />
  Rebuilding stages which the wind had wrecked<br />
  And littered round the beach; but work was done<br />
  By hands scarce conscious of the task, for thought<br />
  Was dazed, and eyes saw nothing but the sea.<br />
  So Rachel moved within her home.  Some friends<br />
  Had come to see her, and had gone away,<br />
  Saying among themselves how old she looked.<br />
  How wan her face, and how her hair had turned<br />
  Within so short a time to ashen grey.<br />
  A picture of her son hung on the wall,<br />
  A boy of three within his father's arms.<br />
  How often had she, in the earlier years<br />
  Following her husband's death, gazed on the face,<br />
  And mused upon the likeness of the two.<br />
  And now each night she got up from her bed,<br />
  Lighted the lamp and held it near the frame,<br />
  While questionings beat sorely at her heart,<br />
  Notes of despair unuttered by the lips:<br />
  Was this, then, after all, the goal of years&mdash;<br />
  The end for which the lad was born, had lived,<br />
  Had grown, for which by night and day she strove,<br />
  The guerdon of life's vigils, and the crown<br />
  Of Love's recordless givings?  Nor was left<br />
  The mother's ancient right, inalienable,<br />
  To challenge death within the last great hour,<br />
  And from his hands to wrest the life she loved.<br />
  There flashed now through her mind, as every time<br />
  She looked upon his face, a night long past,<br />
  When croup had racked his frame&mdash;when she had fought<br />
  Death with a woman's courage as she watched<br />
  The cradle's tiny heavings, till the dawn<br />
  Revealed the cooling moisture on the brow,<br />
  And told her she had won.  In that high test<br />
  She well remembered how her rising strength<br />
  Could pit itself against the Adversary,<br />
  Emerge, though weakened with the night's long fight,<br />
  Triumphant, glad, rejoicing with the morn.<br />
  Absorbed now with the picture and the past,<br />
  She gazed so long that now and then the boy<br />
  Seemed to her wondering eye to stir, and smile,<br />
  And move his lips as if he wished to speak,<br />
  And for a passing moment did a hope<br />
  Flicker a feeble path across her breast,<br />
  That the black menace of the past few days<br />
  Might prove the hideous phantom of a dream,<br />
  When, sudden, through the night's dull gloom, a moan,<br />
  Escaping from the swell, smote on her ear,<br />
  And brought her thoughts back to the eastern storm.<br />
  At length, one morning, into port there sailed<br />
  A vessel from the harbor of St. John's;<br />
  Rounding the cape, she picked up here and there,<br />
  Tidings of wreckage all along the shore&mdash;<br />
  Remnants of spars and cordage, casks and planks,<br />
  And canvas rent in shreds.  She brought a tale<br />
  That bore direct upon the village homes.<br />
  A naiad's head, carven in wood, was found,<br />
  Thrown high upon the reef, the self-same head<br />
  That marked the <i>Swallow's</i> prow, and, lying near,<br />
  A plank that had the vessel's name inscribed.<br />
  Throughout the days and weeks following the storm<br />
  She often left her home to wander off,<br />
  Searching as if some object of her love<br />
  Had strayed upon the moor or on the beach.<br />
  At times she stood awhile and looked, with eyes<br />
  That somehow had forgotten how to weep,<br />
  Far out to sea.  At times she made her way<br />
  Along the shore to where two beetling crags<br />
  Rose from their slippery base, as if they'd break<br />
  The waves with a last crash.  There in the cleft,<br />
  With arms outstretched, she would implore the sea<br />
  Give up its dead, while the resurgent tides,<br />
  Upbraided, would creep guiltily away.<br />
  One evening, when the east winds blew, and rain<br />
  Fell chill upon her, there had come a friend<br />
  Who led her gently to her cottage home,<br />
  And through a long and restless night had stayed<br />
  In watchful ministry close by her bed,<br />
  Soothing the urge of hectic on her brow,<br />
  And answering with a voice instinct with peace,<br />
  The breaking, wayward fragments of her lips.<br />
  Another morn and sleep.  With a white hand<br />
  The day was ushered in.  The seams of pain<br />
  And arid loss which each awakening light<br />
  Had freely veined, now reappeared no more.<br />
  The fall's loud blast that whirled the senile leaves<br />
  Above the trees, she did not hear; nor sound<br />
  Of breaking seas, nor swirl of surge or foam.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . Fields far and near,<br />
  Hills, ridges, valleys, lowlands, marsh and plain,<br />
  Far to the horizon's utmost rim were filled<br />
  With clashing millions.  All earth's tribes<br />
  Had by some common instinct gathered there,<br />
  Peopling the shadows of the awful zone&mdash;<br />
  The forest shades, the fissures of great rocks,<br />
  And caverns cut within the rotted mould;<br />
  Each nation's youth, its lithest, strongest, best,<br />
  Closed up the crimson rendezvous.  The streams<br />
  That ran their livid washings through the clefts<br />
  Of spade or nature's highways, fouled and choked<br />
  With drifted foliage of a year grown old,<br />
  Too soon, with autumn's hectic leaves and limbs,<br />
  And sheddings rare of dearer castaways.<br />
  As leaves fall, so upon the plains fell men;<br />
  Some tossed awhile within the gust of combat,<br />
  High on the sweltered air, returned to earth<br />
  As flesh and blood and bone unrecognized,<br />
  And indistinguishable dust.  Some swayed,<br />
  Not knowing why they did, as if a breath<br />
  Of unnamed pestilence had touched their senses,<br />
  Robbed them of aim and guidance.  Thus they drooped<br />
  And fell; and others could not die till hours<br />
  Wore into days and nights.  Restless they moved.<br />
  And shuddered; clutched convulsively at stones<br />
  Or roots, and clenched their teeth upon their hands,<br />
  Stifling their moans.  And lads of growing years,<br />
  Who pain or weariness had never known,<br />
  Lay in strange sleep upon the fields, alone,<br />
  Or huddled up in ghastly heaps where death<br />
  Had flung them.  Night winds gambolled with their hair,<br />
  Golden and brown and dark&mdash;they heeded not.<br />
  And far along the distant battle lines&mdash;<br />
  Movements as various as the tides, the rise<br />
  The flow, the swift recessions of despair;<br />
  Huge gaps that rendered void the toil of years.<br />
  The lines re-formed and the price paid; strong men<br />
  Who lunged and parried thrusts and lunged again,<br />
  Struck and were struck, unknown to each the foes,<br />
  Save in the general quarrel and its cause.<br />
  And through the lulls of intermittent fight<br />
  Was blown death's bitterest music&mdash;the low sob<br />
  Of brothers mourning brothers dead, the curse<br />
  Of fallen men that had not seen their foes,<br />
  The unavailing moan that answers moan<br />
  At night in the far comradeship of wounds.<br />
  Then, strangest of all sights, the harvest moon<br />
  A moment broke through misty cloud, and shed<br />
  Upon the fields a sickly, yellow light,<br />
  Disclosing pallid faces, blue, strained lips,<br />
  And eyes that stared, amazed, through open lids<br />
  That had no time to shut&mdash;that looked and asked<br />
  But one eternal question.  Then the moon<br />
  Grew dimmer as the mist increased, and showed,<br />
  In hazy outlines, hurrying forms that moved<br />
  In twos and threes, from place to place, and laid<br />
  Upon the stretchers, one by one, the dead,<br />
  Torn, jagged, mud-smeared and crumpled, carrying them<br />
  To rows of damp, deep trenches, newly dug,<br />
  Where they were placed in groups of eight or ten,<br />
  In order, side by side, and face to face&mdash;<br />
  And the moon shone full again&mdash;the harvest moon.<br />

  Your words would tax the heart's belief.  I thought<br />
  That here along these shores when, at the close<br />
  Of a week of storm, the gull alone remained<br />
  Upon the waters, and the blinds were drawn<br />
  Within a hundred homes, that there was left<br />
  On earth nothing that might out-range the winds.<br />

  Death&mdash;Death stalked everywhere on land and sea,<br />
  In clouds that banked the sun, in mists that hid<br />
  The stars, or half disclosed the swollen moon.<br />
  No cavern sunk beneath the earth but bore<br />
  His foot-prints.  Deep below the waters' rim<br />
  Great fish had trailed his scent.  Earth's myriad forms<br />
  Had felt the plague-spot of his rampant touch.<br />
  From the small field-mouse, caught within the fumes<br />
  Of sulphurous air that crept from knoll to knoll,<br />
  Withering the grass blades, to the giant fighter<br />
  Of storm and wave that, ribbed and sheathed with steel,<br />
  Felt the swift scorpion in her sides, then rocked<br />
  And plunged with bellowing nostrils till she sank<br />
  In a wild litany of guns, with wind,<br />
  And night, and flame.  But busier was his hand<br />
  With subtler workmanship.  On eye and brow<br />
  And cheek were delved the traces of his passing&mdash;<br />
  Blindness, that like a thunder-clap at noon.<br />
  Closed on the sight; furrows that struck the veins,<br />
  Turning the red sap from its wonted course;<br />
  Sharp lines of pain and fury and quick hate<br />
  That on the instant changed to graven stone,<br />
  Callous and motionless.  And deadlier still,<br />
  With flying leap he strode a continent,<br />
  Or the wide prairies of a sea, and snatched<br />
  The cup from the wan fingers of a life<br />
  That slaked its thirst upon the wine of hope;<br />
  So sure his hand&mdash;light, as with finger-tips,<br />
  He touched the hair and wove the grey and white<br />
  Within the brown, or hard, with rough-spurred heel,<br />
  He mauled the bosom till its heavings ceased.<br />

  Many there were who, clutching at a straw<br />
  Of some dark saying of the past, some tone,<br />

  Sought for the battered remnants of their faith<br />
  An anchorage; and around a clay-damp grave<br />
  That buried hope with dust would stoop to tie<br />
  Their heartstrings to a pansy, murmuring thus:<br />
  "Who bade this flower renew its own fair lease<br />
  Of youth perennial?  Springs it not this year<br />
  From the same soil and root, with that same pride<br />
  With which a year ago it lifted up<br />

  Think they so to convince the heart with words<br />
  Like those, to mesh it with a logic meet<br />
  For bloodless ends?  What though the winds of May<br />
  Call to the springing rootlets, lure the bud<br />
  From the rose-stem, and chase the resinous sap<br />
  From the pine's trunk to branch and topmost twig&mdash;<br />
  Who yields to such delusion?  Does the spring<br />
  Forget November's hecatombs, the last<br />
  Convulsion of the leaf, the gale-torn limbs<br />
  Of trees scarred to the death, the flowers that danced<br />
  Upon the fields scythed by the autumn's hands.<br />
  The writhen spectres of earth's quick decay<br />
  Flashed out upon the winds?  All these as dust<br />
  Around the season's tombs&mdash;dust-heaps, no more;<br />
  As sands that eddy in the desert, these:<br />
  For these no resurrection.  What amends<br />
  Does summer make for winter's numbing stroke?<br />
  It's death he gives, not slumber.  His pale forms<br />
  Breathe not again, and eyelids that have closed<br />
  On the congealing air reflect no more<br />
  The warm glance of the sun.  The swallows build<br />
  Their nests once more within the eaves; the thrush,<br />
  The red-breast and the lark cover again<br />
  Their young in bush and tree and meadow-grain&mdash;<br />
  <i>They</i> have not died.  But weak ones that, impaled<br />
  Upon the thorn, screamed out their notes of pain,<br />
  Or dashed, wing-broken, by the wildering blast,<br />
  Fell when their strength had failed them on far plains,<br />
  On treeless hills, or dazed in homeward flight,<br />
  Fluttered and sank in furrows of the sea&mdash;<br />

  Not anchored, nor becalmed, but held in spell<br />
  Of some great shock.  She listed heavily<br />
  As though a hidden wound had gripped her loins,<br />
  And in the rain and chill were lowered boats,<br />
  So filled they lacked the margin of an inch<br />
  To meet the water's edge.  A law well known<br />
  To men who live upon the sea here ran<br />
  Its old and honored course.  The boats were few<br />
  And small, and there was left upon the deck<br />
  A sturdier throng who stretched out willing hands<br />
  To save the weak.  One boat hung yet suspended,<br />
  Filled short of obvious risk, and a slim girl<br />
  Stepped out, and gave an aged woman, left<br />
  Unnoticed in the crowd, her place.  Her lips<br />
  Were closed, and her face pale, but yet a smile<br />
  Made soft and sweet the pallor of her cheeks.<br />
  Then out into the night the boat was rowed,<br />
  Steadily and silently.  No clamour broke<br />
  The stillness on the deck, nor was there sound<br />
  Of any voiced farewell, but here and there<br />
  A hand was raised, and a white fluttering<br />
  Answered the distant rhythm of the oars.<br />

  Their hands were placed on the hot flush of wounds<br />

  The world's grey cares on seas of evening-calm...<br />
  Have you not heard such music when the winds<br />

  Upon the greenness of the earth?  They pass,<br />

  The latent rhythms of the daisies blend<br />
  With the low rustle of the sedge.  They pass<br />
  Again, and lo, in grander orchestra,<br />

  A blade of grass, a daisy or a pine,<br />
  A wave, a waterfall, a heart-string, these,<br />

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
